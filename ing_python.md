## **Turdle**
A Wordle clone made in Python using tkinter/ttk. Not nearly as clever as some of the others.

Just a standard Wordle except you can play as much as you want and it can show you your green guesses
in one place, which is sort of useful. *[Turdle on GitHub](https://github.com/Athen-H/Turdle)*

Input can be through keyboard or UI buttons. Gray letters fade on UI keyboard.

Red letters indicate word not found in dictionary as a brief animation:

![Nope](/assets/nuhuh.gif){:style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"}

Or a bad final guess:

Game includes logic that allows strategic guessing for maximal information, the same way Wordle does.

Note below that in the first guess, ARROW,
the first R is yellow, but the second is gray, meaning there should be only one 
R in the word.

In the second guess, PAPAL, the second A is also gray, indicating the same thing for A. (The word was 'rainy')

![PAPAL](/assets/papal.png){:style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"}

In the next guess, FLUFF, F appears in every color. (Except red)

![FLUFF](/assets/fluff.png){:style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"}

This tells us that F is in the word exactly twice and gives precise information at every position in our guess.
The triple-letter guess is risky, but can entirely inform all possibilities for a letter in one guess, even for a double letter word.
Now that's strategic. (Word was 'fifth')

Reset button clears everything from the current game, tells you what the word was
if you didn't guess it, and generates a new word.

Includes two dictionaries, one with 4,177 mostly reasonable 5-letter English words that can be generated by the computer,
and another with 15,918 5-letter words of all kinds that are checked against the input. By design, there are many words you are allowed
to input that would never show up as the actual word.
